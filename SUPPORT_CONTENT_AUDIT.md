## Formatting Issues

### Current Problems:
1. **ALL CAPS headers** (looks aggressive/unprofessional)
2. **No line spacing** between sections
3. **Wall of text** (hard to scan)
4. **Inconsistent formatting** (some sections use bold, others don't)
5. **Too formal/corporate** tone in places

### Preferred Format:
- Use proper heading hierarchy (## for main sections, ### for subsections)
- Add blank lines between paragraphs
- Use bullet points for lists
- More conversational, friendly tone
- Better use of bold for emphasis (not entire sentences)
- Add visual breaks with horizontal rules where appropriate
