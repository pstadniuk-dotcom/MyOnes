Hello Pete! I'm here to help you optimize your health. Let's get started with creating the perfect supplement formula for you.

To give you the best recommendations, I need to understand your complete health picture. Please share as much information as you can about yourself:

• Your age, gender, height, and weight
• Any medications you're currently taking
• Health goals or concerns you have
• Any specific symptoms or issues you're experiencing
• Lifestyle factors (exercise, diet, sleep patterns)

Feel free to click the microphone icon to speak with me, or simply type in the chat. This is just like a doctor's visit - the more you share, the better I can help you.

Before we update your existing formula, could you please provide the following missing information:
- Blood pressure
- Resting heart rate

Once you share this information, I'll be able to analyze your current formula and suggest any adjustments or additions based on your health profile and lab results. Feel free to provide any other details or specific concerns you'd like me to address in the updated formula.
