Thank you for sharing that detailed information about your health and lifestyle. It's great to see you're proactive about managing your health, especially after being diagnosed as pre-diabetic. Let's dive a bit deeper to gather some more critical information to better understand your overall health status.

1. Could you provide your blood pressure readings if you have them? If not, no worries, we can work with that.

2. Do you happen to know your resting heart rate? This can give us valuable insights into your cardiovascular health.

3. How many hours of sleep do you typically get per night? Adequate sleep is crucial for overall health, especially when managing stress and anxiety.

Once we have this additional information, we can move forward to create a personalized supplement formula tailored to your specific health goals and concerns.
