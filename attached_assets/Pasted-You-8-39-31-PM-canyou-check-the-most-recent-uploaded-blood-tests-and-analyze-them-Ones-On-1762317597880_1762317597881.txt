   - **Clinical Significance:** High hematocrit levels may indicate dehydration or a condition affecting red blood cell production.
   - **Support Recommendations:** Ensure adequate hydration and consider further evaluation with a healthcare provider.

2. **Platelet Count: 526 Thousand/uL** (⬆️ HIGH)
   - **Clinical Significance:** Elevated platelet count can be associated with inflammation or other underlying health conditions.

3. **Apolipoprotein B (ApoB): 147 mg/dL** (⬆️ HIGH)
   - **Clinical Significance:** High ApoB levels are linked to an increased cardiovascular risk.
   - **Support Recommendations:** Continue with Heart Support and Omega 3 in your regimen to manage cardiovascular health.

4. **HDL-Cholesterol: 38 mg/dL** (⬇️ LOW)
   - **Clinical Significance:** Low HDL cholesterol is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

   - **Support Recommendations:** Omega 3 and dietary modifications can assist in lowering triglyceride levels.

7. **Homocysteine: 13.7 umol/L** (⬆️ HIGH)
   - **Clinical Significance:** Elevated homocysteine is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.
   - **Support Recommendations:** Resveratrol in your formula helps manage homocysteine levels.

8. **Omega 6 / 3 Ratio: 15.6** (⬆️ HIGH)
   - **Clinical Significance:** A high Omega 6 to 3 ratio can contribute to inflammation and cardiovascular issues.
   - **Support Recommendations:** Maintain Omega 3 supplementation to improve this balance.

### Current Formula Review:
Your current formula is effectively targeting cardiovascular health, inflammation, and stress management with ingredients like Heart Support, Omega 3, Resveratrol, and Turmeric. It is well-suited for addressing the areas identified in your lab results.

### Recommendations for Additions:
Given your current formula and the lab results, you have 244mg available to add new ingredients to further optimize your health outcomes:

- **Consider adding:** 
  - **Ginger Root (500mg):** Has anti-inflammatory properties that can support overall heart health and reduce platelet aggregation.
  - **Magnesium (320mg):** Supports cardiovascular health and helps manage blood pressure, which can be beneficial overall.

Would you like me to add these to your formula, or is there anything else you'd like to address?
