I've analyzed your blood test results. Here's what I found:

### Biomarker Interpretation Table:
| Biomarker | Actual Value | Reference Range | Clinical Significance | Suggested Ingredient |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| **Hematocrit** | 54.2% | High | Indicates potential dehydration or polycythemia | - |
| **Platelet Count** | 526 Thousand/uL | High | Risk of clotting; monitor cardiovascular health | - |
| **RBC Count** | 5.99 Million/uL | High | Could be linked to high hematocrit | - |
| **RDW** | 16.7% | High | Variation in red blood cell size; check for deficiencies | - |
| **Calcium** | 10.4 mg/dL | High | Monitor for hypercalcemia | - |
| **ApoB** | 147 mg/dL | High | Elevated cardiovascular risk | Heart Support (450mg) |
| **HDL-Cholesterol** | 38 mg/dL | Low | Low HDL can indicate increased cardiovascular risk | Omega 3 (algae omega) (300mg) |
| **LDL Medium** | 285 nmol/L | High | LDL pattern B associated with greater risk | Heart Support (450mg) |
| **LDL Particle Number** | 1776 nmol/L | High | Increased atherogenic risk | Omega 3 (algae omega) (300mg) |
| **Total Cholesterol** | 221 mg/dL | High | Elevated cardiovascular risk | Heart Support (450mg) |
| **Triglycerides** | 180 mg/dL | High | May indicate metabolic issues | Omega 3 (algae omega) (300mg) |
| **Homocysteine** | 13.7 umol/L | High | Elevated levels can increase cardiovascular risk | - |
| **Omega 6/3 Ratio** | 15.6 | High | Imbalance in fatty acids; consider Omega 3 supplementation | Omega 3 (algae omega) (300mg) |

### Current Formula Review:
Your current formula "Pete V1" totals 3006mg, with a target range of 4500-5500mg. Here's what's covered:
- **Heart Support** and **Omega 3** already address cardiovascular concerns.
- **CoEnzyme Q10** supports heart health.
- **Ginko Biloba** aids circulation.

### Recommendations:
To address your lab results, we can enhance your formula, specifically targeting cardiovascular health and omega balance. We can add:
- **Omega 3 (algae omega)** (an additional 300mg) to improve your Omega 6/3 ratio and support HDL levels.
- **Resveratrol** (200mg) for cardiovascular support and to help manage homocysteine levels.

### Dosage Calculations:
- **Current Total:** 3006mg
- **Additions Recommended:** 
  - Omega 3 (300mg)
  - Resveratrol (200mg)
- **New Total:** 3506mg + 500mg (additions) = 4006mg

We have room to add more, but let's start with these adjustments. Would you like me to proceed with these additions, or is there anything else you'd like to address?
