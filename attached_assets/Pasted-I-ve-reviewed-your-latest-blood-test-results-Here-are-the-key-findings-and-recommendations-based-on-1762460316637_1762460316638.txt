I've reviewed your latest blood test results. Here are the key findings and recommendations based on your current health profile:

### Key Biomarkers

1. **Total Cholesterol:** 221 mg/dL (High)
   - Reference: <200 mg/dL
   - Clinical Significance: Elevated total cholesterol increases the risk of cardiovascular disease.
   - Recommendation: Consider Heart Support, which contains L-Carnitine and Coenzyme Q10 to support lipid metabolism.

2. **LDL-Cholesterol:** 151 mg/dL (High)
   - Reference: <100 mg/dL
   - Clinical Significance: High LDL cholesterol is a critical risk factor for heart disease.
   - Recommendation: Heart Support can assist in managing LDL levels.

3. **HDL-Cholesterol:** 38 mg/dL (Low)
   - Reference: >40 mg/dL
   - Clinical Significance: Lower HDL levels offer less cardiovascular protection.
   - Recommendation: Increase Omega 3 intake to potentially improve HDL levels.

4. **Triglycerides:** 180 mg/dL (High)
   - Reference: <150 mg/dL
   - Clinical Significance: High triglycerides are linked to cardiovascular risk.
   - Recommendation: Omega 3 (algae omega) is beneficial for triglyceride management.

5. **Apolipoprotein B (ApoB):** 147 mg/dL (High)
   - Reference: <90 mg/dL
   - Clinical Significance: Elevated ApoB is associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk.
   - Recommendation: Heart Support may help manage ApoB levels.

6. **Hematocrit:** 54.2% (High)
   - Reference: 38.3-48.6%
   - Clinical Significance: High hematocrit might indicate dehydration or other underlying conditions.
   - Recommendation: Ensure adequate hydration and consider further evaluation if persistent.

7. **Platelet Count:** 526 Thousand/uL (High)
   - Reference: 140-400 Thousand/uL
   - Clinical Significance: Elevated platelet count may suggest inflammatory conditions or other issues.
   - Recommendation: Monitor and discuss with a healthcare provider.

### Current Formula Review

Your current supplement regimen includes Heart Support and Omega 3, which target many of the lipid concerns identified in your lab results. Consider maintaining these and possibly increasing Omega 3 dosage to better manage HDL and triglyceride levels.

### Additional Recommendations

1. **Hydration and Lifestyle:** Ensure you stay well-hydrated and discuss any persistent hematocrit or platelet issues with your healthcare provider.
2. **Regular Monitoring:** Keep track of your lipid levels and consult your doctor to adjust your plan as needed.
