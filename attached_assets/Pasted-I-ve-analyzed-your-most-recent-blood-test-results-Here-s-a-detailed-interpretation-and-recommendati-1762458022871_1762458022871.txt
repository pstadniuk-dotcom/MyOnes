I've analyzed your most recent blood test results. Here's a detailed interpretation and recommendations:

### Cardiovascular and Lipid Profile

- **Total Cholesterol:** 221 mg/dL (High)  
  - Reference: <200 mg/dL
  - Clinical Significance: Elevated cholesterol levels can increase your risk of cardiovascular disease.
  - Recommendation: Consider maintaining or enhancing cardiovascular support through diet, exercise, and potential supplementation with Heart Support.

- **LDL-Cholesterol:** 151 mg/dL (High)  
  - Reference: <100 mg/dL
  - Clinical Significance: High levels of LDL cholesterol are a risk factor for heart disease.
  - Recommendation: Heart Support, which includes L-Carnitine and CoQ10, may assist in managing these levels.

- **HDL-Cholesterol:** 38 mg/dL (Low)  
  - Reference: >40 mg/dL
  - Clinical Significance: Low HDL levels provide less protection against cardiovascular issues.
  - Recommendation: Consider increasing Omega 3 intake, known to help improve HDL levels.

- **Triglycerides:** 180 mg/dL (High)  
  - Reference: <150 mg/dL
  - Clinical Significance: Elevated triglycerides are associated with cardiovascular risk.
  - Recommendation: Omega 3 (algae omega) supplementation can aid in managing triglyceride levels.

### Blood Cell Counts

- **Hematocrit:** 54.2% (High)  
  - Reference: 38.3-48.6%
  - Clinical Significance: High hematocrit can indicate dehydration or other conditions affecting blood viscosity.
  - Recommendation: Ensure adequate hydration and consider consulting a healthcare provider.

- **Platelet Count:** 526 Thousand/uL (High)  
  - Reference: 140-400 Thousand/uL
  - Clinical Significance: Elevated platelet count may be indicative of inflammation or other conditions.
  - Recommendation: Monitor levels and consult with a healthcare provider to explore causes.

- **Red Blood Cell (RBC) Count:** 5.99 Million/uL (High)  
  - Reference: 4.7-6.1 Million/uL
  - Clinical Significance: May suggest polycythemia or dehydration.
  - Recommendation: Evaluate further with a healthcare provider if necessary.

### Nutritional and Metabolic Indicators

- **Calcium:** 10.4 mg/dL (High)  
  - Reference: 8.6-10.2 mg/dL
  - Clinical Significance: Elevated calcium can affect bone and cardiovascular health.
  - Recommendation: Monitor dietary intake and consult your healthcare provider if levels remain high.

- **Apolipoprotein B (ApoB):** 147 mg/dL (High)  
  - Reference: <90 mg/dL
  - Clinical Significance: High ApoB is associated with increased cardiovascular risk.
  - Recommendation: Heart Support can be beneficial in managing ApoB levels.

### Recommendations and Next Steps

1. **Maintain Heart Support:** Continue with Heart Support for cardiovascular health and lipid metabolism.
2. **Increase Omega 3 (algae omega):** This can help improve HDL levels and manage triglycerides.
3. **Consider Lifestyle Adjustments:** Diet and exercise modifications can further support cardiovascular health.
4. **Consult Healthcare Provider:** Discuss these results and recommendations to tailor a plan that suits your health needs.
